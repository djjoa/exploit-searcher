# exploit-searcher
Simultaneously search CVEs and exploits across multiple cybersecurity data sources. 

## Forenote 
This project is still a work in progress. Open collaboration is welcomed and encouraged. Please just submit a pull request. 

## Overview 
Pentesting is a cyclical process involving discovery of new services, frameworks, and technologies throughout the duration of the test. During the enumeration phase, substantial information of a target is obtained via popular tools such as Nmap and Nikto; however, there are some gaps in the information obtained from of these tools if the host can't be directly scanned by them. Exploit-searcher aims to fill the gaps between the initial reconnaisance phase and exploitation phase by aggregating CVE's, exploits, and papers across multiple cybersecurity sources. 

### Data Sources 
- nvd.nist.gov
- exploit-db 
- cvedetails
- rapid7
- Packet Storm 

# Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/djjoa/exploit-searcher.git
[py | python | python3] -m pip install -r requirements.txt
[py | python | python3] exploit-searcher.py -h 

python .\exploit-searcher.py -h             
usage: exploit-searcher.py [-h] [-v] -s SEARCH [-e {edb,rapid7,packetstorm,cve,nvd}] [-c CVE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         doesn't actually do anything yet
  -s SEARCH, --search SEARCH
                        the search term to query all databases for (exploit, vulnerability, CVE, technology, framework)
  -e {edb,rapid7,packetstorm,cve,nvd}, --engine {edb,rapid7,packetstorm,cve,nvd}
                        engines to use in query; defaults to ALL
  -c CVE, --cve CVE     CVE ID to refine search
```
## Usage 
Query `SaltStack` across all datasources 

```
python .\exploit-searcher.py -s 'SaltStack'
```
