# exploit-searcher
Simultaneously search CVEs and exploits across multiple cybersecurity data sources. 

## Forenote 
This project is still a work in progress. Open collaboration is welcomed and encouraged. Please just submit a pull request. 

## Overview 
Pentesting is a cyclical process involving discovery of new services, frameworks, and technologies throughout the duration of the test. During the enumeration phase, substantial information of a target is obtained via popular tools such as Nmap and Nikto; however, there are some gaps in the information obtained from of these tools if the host can't be directly scanned by them. Exploit-searcher aims to fill the gaps between the initial reconnaisance phase and exploitation phase by aggregating CVE's, exploits, and papers across multiple cybersecurity sources.
