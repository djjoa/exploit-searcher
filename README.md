# exploit-searcher
Simultaneously search CVEs and exploits across multiple cybersecurity data sources. 

## Forenote 
This project is still a work in progress. Open collaboration is welcomed and encouraged. Please submit a pull request or reach out to me on Discord. 

## Overview 
Pentesting is a cyclical process involving discovery of new services, frameworks, and technologies. Substantial host information is obtained via popular scanning tools such as Nmap, Nikto, etc. but scanning tools fall short when new frameworks and technologies are revealed which can't be scanned directly. 

Exploit-searcher aims to fill the gaps between the initial reconnaissance phase and exploitation phase by aggregating CVE's, exploits, and papers across multiple cybersecurity sources. 

### Data Sources 
- nvd.nist.gov
- ~~exploit-db~~ EDB currently not indexable 
- cvedetails
- rapid7
- Packet Storm 

# Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/djjoa/exploit-searcher.git
[py | python | python3] -m pip install -r requirements.txt
[py | python | python3] exploit-searcher.py -h 

python .\exploit-searcher.py -h             
usage: exploit-searcher.py [-h] [-v] -s SEARCH [-e {edb,rapid7,packetstorm,cve,nvd}] [-c CVE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         doesn't actually do anything yet
  -s SEARCH, --search SEARCH
                        the search term to query all databases for (exploit, vulnerability, CVE, technology, framework)
  -e {edb,rapid7,packetstorm,cve,nvd}, --engine {edb,rapid7,packetstorm,cve,nvd}
                        engines to use in query; defaults to ALL
  -c CVE, --cve CVE     CVE ID to refine search
```
## Usage 
Query `SaltStack` across all datasources 

```
python .\exploit-searcher.py -s 'SaltStack'
```
